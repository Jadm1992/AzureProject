# My Azure Learning Project

## ðŸ“‹ Steps I Followed

1. **Created an Azure Account**  
   I signed up for a [Free Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). You can also choose Pay-As-You-Go.

2. **Logged into the Azure Portal**  
   Accessed the portal at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) to start working with cloud resources.

3. **Explored the Azure Portal**  
   Got familiar with key services like:  
   - **Resource Groups** â€“ to organize resources  
   - **Virtual Machines** â€“ for cloud-based computing  
   - **Entra ID** â€“ for identity and access management

4. **Created a Resource Group**  
   Made a new Resource Group to keep everything organized.

5. **Set Up a Storage Account**  
   Created a Storage Account inside the Resource Group to manage files and blobs.

6. **Created a Local Text File**  
   Made a `.txt` file on my Mac desktop using TextEdit (switched to *Plain Text* mode).

7. **Uploaded the File to Azure**  
   Uploaded the text file to a Blob Container in my Storage Account via the Azure Portal.

8. **Edited the File in the Portal**  
   Used the built-in editor in Azure to make and save changes directly.

9. **Downloaded and Reviewed the File**  
   Downloaded the edited file and confirmed the changes were applied.

10. **Deleted the Resource Group**  
    Deleted the entire Resource Group to remove all resources and avoid charges.

11. **Checked Cost Management**  
    Went to *Cost Management > Cost Analysis* to confirm there were no remaining costs.
